# TagCloud

This is a simple tag cloud generator.

The data in supllied by a Json file×ª wich is hard coded gere but can come
from the server of course :).

I desided to count only four words in one row. 
But you can chage that number or count the size (in pixels) of each row
and then limit it and move for the next row.
